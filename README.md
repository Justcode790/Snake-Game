# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake Game built using **React** for the UI, with **JavaScript** logic and **CSS** for styling. The game features smooth controls, score tracking, and increasing difficulty as the snake grows. It's a fun way to demonstrate React's state management and component-based structure.
